# product-dashboard-vanilla-js

This project is a simple Product Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches and displays product data from an external API and uses both promise-based (`.then()`) and async/await (`async/await`) methods for fetching. Each product is rendered as a card showing its image, name, and price.
